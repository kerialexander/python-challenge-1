# Python Challenge 1 - Menu Creation 
Python Challenge 1 - Menu Creation

## Project Overview and Origin
The goal of this project was to create a menu with submenus that allowed customers to order items from each of the submenus and then created a receipt with the items, their quantities, and corresponding prices from the menu starter code provided in the AI Week 2 course module.

### Programming Language
Python programming language was used to create the code for this project in Visual Studio Code.

### Data Validation 

To ensure that the menu program ran as intended, data validation tools were implemented. Specifically, the code was designed to ensure that the customer input valid menu options and if invalid input was entered, the code was written to produce error messages advising the customer to enter valid input.

**_Valid Menu Options_**: The code was written to produce an error code if the customer did not enter a valid integer for the menu number.

**_Valid Quantities_**: If the customer did not input a valid response for the quantity of the selected item, the code was set to default to a quantity of one.

## Resources 
To obtain assistance with the alignment of the columns for the total, I requested assistance from the course TA.
